<p>I was, and, I suppose I still technically am, a math major.  Looking to apply mathematics to something practical after graduation, I, one day, stumbled upon data science.  Shortly thereafter I joined a data science bootcamp.  I like to think of this blog as a place for me to share what I have learned about data science so far.</p>
